# ü§≥üèæCaptionAI

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-link>`

```
`git clone https://github.com/Michelle-Watson/digital-dreamers-server`
`git clone https://github.com/Michelle-Watson/digital-dreamers`
```

### Setup Server

1. `cd .\server\`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set environment variables in a `.env` file. An example is in the repos `.env.sample`. See example below:

```
# Server: Backend API route, what our server uses
PORT=5051
CAPTIONER_URL=https://pallyy.com/api/tools/image-to-caption/get
IMG_HOST_URL=https://api.imgbb.com/1/upload
IMG_HOST_API_KEY=
```

- `IMG_HOST_API_KEY` will be generated by you

4. Configure imgbb API

- Create an account to accessimgbb API (https://imgbb.com/)
- You can view your API key here: https://api.imgbb.com/
- Copy and paste that API key in your `.env` after `IMG_HOST_API_KEY=`

#### Run Server

- Start the server: `npm start`
- Access the server at: `http://localhost:5051`
  - The PORT will be whatever you send in the `.env` file. The example set `PORT=5051`, so you will access the server on that port as well
- **ASIDE**: You can see the testing of the API with my publicly available Postman collection
  - Specifically: see POST: Post data / get caption DIRECT to test the public API, and ['POST: Post data / get caption LOCAL'](https://www.postman.com/aerospace-architect-73612045/workspace/industry/collection/37613824-3bb7811b-7dca-4b6e-81c6-949e636b3acb?action=share&creator=37613824) to test to see if your local server is set up correctly

### Setup Client

1. `cd .\game-finder\`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set environment variables in a `.env` file. An example is in the repos `.env.sample`. See example below:

```
# Environment variables in the client app must be prefixed with VITE_
# PORT needs to match BACKEND API Route, we set it as 5051
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5051
```

#### Run Client

- Start the server: `npm run dev`
- Access the app at: `http://localhost:5051`

## Overview

A user-friendly tool designed to empower elders to share their memories with ease. With just a few clicks, they can upload their photos, and CaptionAI provides thoughtful caption suggestions to spark their creativity.  

The best part? These suggestions are just starting points. Users have complete freedom to edit, tweak, or craft their own captions, ensuring every post feels personal and uniquely theirs.


### Problem Space

###### Why this app is needed. Background information and pain points.

Meta believes AI is for everyone. Meta has been at the forefront of AI development and integration. They‚Äôre creating brand new AI products as well as integrating AI features into their existing products such as Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. From making your own AIs to having Meta AI identify what‚Äôs around you, Meta‚Äôs leading AI features help their users learn, create and do more than ever. However, only 9% of Canadian businesses are using Gen AI. At the same time, public trust in AI is low: only 31% of Canadians trust AI, 23 percentage points lower than the global average. As AI integrates into daily life across all platforms, adoption is important‚Ä¶ And fun!
